Shane Bolding
Data Structures and Algorithms II
Project 2
User's Manual

Setup and Compilation
1.Download and unzip boldings-p2.zip from elearning to a Linux box in the multi-platform lab.
2.The zip file should contain:
	*sim.c
	*sim.h
	*equations.c
	*equations.h
	*main.c
	*makefile
	*ReadMe.txt
	*FunctionalDecomposition.txt
3.Enviroment: This project should work on the multi-platform lab.
4.Compiling: The makefile listed above should compile everything if you
type make. This should make an runnable program named run.

Running the project. Make sure everything all files are in the same directory and type ./run

User input: users are prompted/required to imput lambda, mu, M, and n as shown below:
Please enter these four values to begin the program
Lambda: 2
mu: 3
M: 2
n: 5000

Output: all output should be shown in the console and should look like:
